    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We build a second Agent (Pandas) in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We used another  Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 10**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

       "\n",
       "Obesity is a significant risk factor for severe illness and complications related to COVID-19. Here are some key findings from the retrieved documents:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Increased Severity**: Studies have shown that obesity is highly frequent among critically ill patients with COVID-19, and it remains difficult to elucidate the mechanisms by which COVID-19 severity is increased in the context of obesity<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Cardiac Complications**: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are obese have presented cardiac complications, including myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death. Myocardial response in COVID-19 is closely associated with in-hospital mortality, indicating the impact of obesity on the severity of COVID-19<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Risk of Severe Disease**: Obese patients with COVID-19 have increased odds of progressing to severe illness. They are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms and have a negative prognosis compared to non-obese patients<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0576\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Impact on Mortality**: Two-thirds of people who developed serious or fatal COVID-19-related complications were overweight or obese. Almost 72% of those in critical care units were either overweight or obese, highlighting the impact of obesity on seriously ill COVID-19 patients<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22844\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Mechanistic Framework**: There is a theoretical mechanistic framework whereby adipose tissue in subjects with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation, and cytokine amplification, leading to poor COVID-19 outcomes<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.004\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "### How Covid Affects Elderly People\n",
       "\n",
       "Elderly people are at a higher risk of more serious and possibly fatal illness associated with COVID-19. Here are some key findings from the retrieved documents:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Mortality Risk**: Mortality data indicates a risk of mortality of 3.6% for people in their 60s, which increases to 8.0% and 14.8% for people in their 70s and over 80s. This highlights the increased risk of mortality for elderly individuals<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15274\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Severity of Illness**: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is affecting elderly people worldwide with greater incidence and severity. In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.004\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Risk Interactions Across Age Groups**: The risk of coronavirus infection among elderly people is significantly affected by other age groups.

       "The \"Kidney Heist\" legend is a well-known urban legend that has circulated widely over the past fifteen years. The legend typically begins with the classic urban-legend opening: \"A friend of a friend...\" and involves a story about a person who wakes up in an ice-filled bathtub after being drugged, only to discover that one of their kidneys has been stolen. There are numerous versions of this legend, but they all share three core elements: the drugged drink, the ice-filled bathtub, and the kidney-theft punch line. The story is often set in a specific location, which varies depending on where it is told, adding localized details that enhance its credibility and effect<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Made_To_Stick.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">source</a></sup>.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Constraint Logic Programming (CLP):** This refers to a powerful extension of conventional logic programming that involves the incorporation of constraint languages and constraint solving methods into logic programming languages. It was first introduced by Jaffar and Lassez in 1986 as a general framework for a logic programming language that is parametrized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation, yielding soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **CLP(FD) - Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains:** This is an extension of logic programming where logical variables are assigned a domain and relations between variables are described with constraints. A solution to a CLP(FD) program is a valuation of every variable in its own domain such that no constraint is falsified. Solutions are found using two mechanisms: propagation and enumeration. The goal of CLP(FD) is to generate a CLP(FD) constraint between the input and output variables of an imperative program<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0506/0506005v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Relevance to Computer Science Research:** CLP has been extensively researched in the context of logic programming, constraint logic grammars, and their applications in computational linguistics. It involves the incorporation of constraint languages and constraint solving methods into logic programming languages, providing a powerful framework for various applications<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\n",

       "Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a powerful extension of conventional logic programming that incorporates constraint languages and constraint-solving methods into logic programming languages. The name CLP was first introduced by Jaffar and Lassez in 1986 for a general framework of a logic programming language that is parameterized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation. This framework yields soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language [1](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "CLP provides an operational treatment of various frameworks by embedding arbitrary logical languages into constraint logic programs. Definite clause specifications over such constraint languages then define grammars as constraint logic programs, i.e., as sets of axiomatic interpreted definite clauses. The prediction problem in this setting involves inferring an answer proving the implication to be a logical consequence of the program [1](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "The approach of CLP is also discussed in the context of constraint logic grammars (CLGs), which are understood as grammars formulated by means of a suitable logical language that can be used as a constraint language in the CLP scheme. This connection provides an operational treatment of purely declaratively specified grammars, enabling a clear model-theoretic characterization of linguistic objects by specifying grammars as sets of descriptions from a suitable logical description language, called the constraint language [1](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "The operational properties of the CLP scheme are discussed in the formalism CUF, which offers the operational properties of the CLP scheme but gives up the connection to the model-theoretic specifications of the underlying feature-based grammars. Another approach is defined by Götz and Meurers, who define an explicit translation from a logical language close to that of King into constraint logic programs, preserving the prediction problem by generating a constraint logic program [1](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D).\n",

       "1. **Developmental Aspect of Boundaries**: The document emphasizes that boundaries come after bonding. Children must have secure bonding before they can effectively learn to set boundaries and move away from others. Good connections naturally lead to the development of boundaries and independence.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Instilling vs. Repairing Boundaries**: Teaching responsibility, limit setting, and delay of gratification early on can lead to smoother later years of a child's life. The document suggests that the later parents start, the harder they and their children have to work on boundary development.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Boundary Development in Children**: The work of boundary development in children is described as the work of learning responsibility. Teaching children the merits and limits of responsibility prepares them for adulthood tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Boundary Needs of Children**: Boundaries play a crucial role in meeting important needs in children, such as self-protection. The document emphasizes that boundaries are designed to keep the good in and the bad out, and skills such as saying no, telling the truth, and maintaining physical distance need to be developed in the family structure to allow the child to take on the responsibility of self-protection.\n",
